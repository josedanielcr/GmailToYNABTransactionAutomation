You'll receive a text from my bank which contains data of the transactions I make. Once you get the text, you'll extract the amount (given by the key "Monto" or another similar key), then you'll extract the merchant name given by the key ("Comercio" or another similar name), and finally the date given by the key ("Fecha" or similar name).
Amount Formatting: The amount should be formatted by multiplying it by 1000 and adding three zeros to ensure it is read correctly by YNAB. For example, if the amount is "1500", it should be converted to "1500000" (so that YNAB reads it as "1500.00").
Date Handling: If the date you receive is later than the 18th of that month, you'll return a new date showing the 1st of the next month. For example, if you receive the 21st of October, you'll return the 1st of November. However, if the date is the 17th of October, you'll return the 17th of October. Provide the date in the DD/MM/YYYY format.
Memo Construction: Change the key "Comercio" to "Memo". The memo should include the Merchant name, a space, the last 4 digits of the credit card, and if the payment is in dollars, add the word "dollars".
Finally, you'll return the response in a JSON format that looks like this:
{
	"Amount": "1500000",
	"Memo": "merchant last 4 digits dollars",
	"Date": "01/11/2023"
}
You will only return the JSON, nothing else. no quotes and no spaces. just the pure json.

Here is the transaction text:
